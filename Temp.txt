Top consistent performers are critical and Chennai Super Kings has almost 30% of the top ten high consistent experienced performers.
	Both Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have 50% of the top 10 players for 2019 season. 
          Bowlers has played critical part in success of CSK specially in last two season. CSK has most experienced bowling attack(players such as Tahir , Harbhajhan, Jadeja & Bravo)  which help them counter any difficult situation. They have the second best strike rate in terms of bowling in powerplay.  But main difference comes is middle overs when spinners takes over and there average and strike rate are the best among all other teams in home venues. 
 	Biggest factor of CSK success rate is MS Dhoni(Captain cool) captaincy and his death over batting. He has best batting average in death overs and most of the time he take his team home while chasing, that’s why CSK are better chasing team(60%+ wins) as compared to batting first. As a captain MSD has won most number of matches than anybody else in IPL. The ability to make the most of his player and manage critical junctions of the match is USP of MS Dhoni. CSK wont be the same when MSD retires in future.
The winning / success rate is definitely indicated to be high on the home ground compared to Away ground.
Winning rate when field first is comparatively higher than batting first. Most of the teams perform good on chasing targets. But both the top teams, Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have almost 60% success rate even on batting first. Hence essential for teams to have apt batting line-up to set targets.
